# An Insight into Twitter Networks of Central Banks
The project focuses on studying the presence of banks on social media, using three central banks as case studies: the European Central Bank (ECB), the Federal Reserve (Fed), and the Bank of England (BoE).

The primary objective of this project is to gain insights into the intricate dynamics of the social affiliation network, examine the dissemination of information within it, and analyze how banks interact with users. The analysis encompasses several aspects, including the identification of communities within the network, exploration of homophily through focus closure and membership closure, examination of information distribution, topic modeling with a network approach, evaluation of hashtags, and sentiment analysis.

## Features:
- Social Affiliation Network Analysis:
  - Generating and analyzing the social affiliation network based on user interactions.<div align="center"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andreramolivaz/Social_Network_Analysis/main/gephi/output/Schermata%202023-06-21%20alle%2009.48.33.png" width="600" height="350" /></div>
  -  Identifying communities within the network using modularity community detection. <div align="center"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andreramolivaz/Social_Network_Analysis/main/gephi/output/Schermata%202023-06-21%20alle%2009.48.23.png" width="600" height="350" /></div>
  - Exploring the concept of homophily, specifically focus closure and membership closure, to understand the patterns of interaction within communities.
- Information Distribution Analysis:
  - Examining how information flows within the social affiliation network.
  - Analyzing the distribution of information among different communities and influential users.
- Topic Modeling:
  - Applying topic modeling techniques to identify the main themes and topics of discussion among the central banks and their interactions with users.
  - Utilizing a network approach to understand how topics spread and evolve within the social affiliation network.
- Hashtag Evaluation:
  - Evaluating the usage and impact of hashtags employed by central banks on social media.
  - Analyzing the popularity, reach, and engagement of hashtags to assess their effectiveness in driving conversations and disseminating information.
- Sentiment Analysis:
  - Performing sentiment analysis on tweets exclusively made by central banks to gauge the sentiment expressed in their communications.
  - Extending the sentiment analysis to include tweets from all users, enabling an understanding of public sentiment towards central banks and their messages.
